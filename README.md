DinoRun in Python: 
Description: The Dino_Run_Capstone(2).py program demonstrates the Dino Run game with additional features and original
graphics.The user can press 'space' for the dino to jump, 'P' or 'p' to pause and unpause and 'R' or 'r' to restart
the game. There are two kinds obstacles in the game, the cacti and a thunder. Every 100 points the cacti start
coming at a faster pace to increase difficulty. The thunder starts coming down from the cloud after 400 points to make
the game harder. If the dino has collision with any of the two then the game is over. A coin appears randomly and if the dino
collects it then extra points are added to the score. Every 100 points the time of the day changes from sunrise to
noon, then afternoon, sunset and night. At night stars appear in the sky and a planet moves across the sky. Every time
you loose you can press 'R' or 'r' to try again.
Bug: Sometimes the coin appears on the cacti
